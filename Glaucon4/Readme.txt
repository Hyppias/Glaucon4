Glaucon Copyright 2018, by E.Terwiel, the Netherlands,
except other rights in foundational software.

Glaucon is heavily based on Frame3DD by Henry P. Gavin (http://frame3dd.sf.net/)
However, Glaucon is written in C# and uses Math.Net for mathematical routines,
instead of home-brew programs.

Output can be generated in XML and in HTML.
The XML output will make it possible to format output data in various ways,
like CSV, HTML or TXT, by using XSLT.

A simple HTML output routine is incorporated in Glaucon.

Using the built-in XML and HTML is optional, by setting some input constants.

Graphical output consists of a GNUPlot script, like in Frame3DD, but again: heavily adapted.
The plot is an important testing tool.
